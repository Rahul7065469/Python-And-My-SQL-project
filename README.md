# Heart Disease Analysis Project
**Project Overview**
Heart disease is a significant global health concern, and data can play a crucial role in understanding its risk factors. This project involved analyzing heart disease data using Python and SQL to uncover patterns and extract meaningful insights. From cleaning raw data to performing SQL queries, this project demonstrates my ability to transform complex datasets into valuable healthcare insights.

**Data Cleaning (Pandas)**
The first step was to clean and prepare the dataset using pandas. This process included:

Handling missing values to ensure no critical data was lost
Fixing inconsistencies in patient records
Removing duplicate entries to maintain data integrity
This step was essential to ensure the dataset was accurate, reliable, and ready for in-depth analysis.

**Loading Data into SQL**
Once the data was cleaned, it was loaded into an SQL database for structured storage and efficient querying. Organizing the data in SQL allowed for a more systematic approach to extracting insights.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)**
With the data structured in SQL, various queries were executed to uncover important trends related to heart disease. Some key findings included:

Identified patients over 50 with high cholesterol levels
Categorized patients based on their exercise habits to observe patterns
Analyzed the average BMI of heart disease patients to identify correlations
Discovered how many patients had both high blood pressure and diabetes
Examined the percentage of heart disease patients with high alcohol consumption
These insights provided valuable information about the factors contributing to heart disease, which can be useful for preventive healthcare strategies.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
Python (pandas) for data cleaning and preparation
SQL (MySQL) for database management and data analysis
Kaggle for initial data exploration and dataset sourcing

**Project Goals and Takeaways**
This project aimed to go beyond writing SQL queries by using data to generate real-world insights. The primary goals were to:

Understand lifestyle factors affecting heart disease
Identify key health risks based on data-driven insights
Demonstrate the integration of Python and SQL for effective data analysis
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and generating meaningful insights from healthcare data. It reinforced my ability to analyze complex datasets and turn them into valuable information that can inform better decisions.

**Final Thoughts**
This project provided an opportunity to combine technical skills with real-world impact. It strengthened my ability to clean, organize, and analyze large datasets while deepening my understanding of how data can be used to improve healthcare insights. This experience further solidified my passion for data analytics and its potential to drive meaningful change.
